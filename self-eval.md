# Self Evaluation

- This final CFU encompassed everything you've learned in Mod 0, and maybe even required some learning outside of what you've explicitly been taught. How did it feel as you faced these challenges?

  It felt good, I was able to put everything together pretty well.

- How is your workflow going, in terms of taking breaks, staying focused, etc.?

  It is going well, I am generally able to complete one project, take a quick break, and move on to the next. Breaking it up like that helps me stay focues while I am at my computer.

- What do you need to do to be ready for intense technical lessons and challenges like this, for 6 hours/day next week? What support do you need?

  Good rest before the week starts to start on a good note. My setup is working well.
